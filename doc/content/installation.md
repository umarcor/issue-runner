## CLI tool

The CLI tool is a static binary written in golang, which can optionally use `docker`. It can be downloaded from [github.com/umarcor/issue-runner/releases](https://github.com/umarcor/issue-runner/releases), or it can be built from sources.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/umarcor/issue-runner
cd tool
go build -o issue-runner
```

<!--
```sh
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/umarcor/issue-runner/master/tool/get.sh | sh -
```

> You can give it a try at [play-with-docker.com](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/). Just create a node and run the command above.
